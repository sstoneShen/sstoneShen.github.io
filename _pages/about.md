<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Sitong, a first-year PhD student at [AIoT Lab](https://aiot.hku.hk/) in the University of Hong Kong [(HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by [Dr.Chenshu Wu](https://cswu.me/). Before that, I got my B.Eng in Ocean Engineering and Technology from Zhejiang University [(ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/).

My current research interest lies in underwater sensing. My long term vision is to build low-power, low-cost and applicable underwater sensor.
