# 🕵️‍♀️ About This Lady
I am Sitong, a second-year PhD student at [AIoT Lab](https://aiot.hku.hk/) in the University of Hong Kong [(HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Chenshu Wu](https://cswu.me/). Before that, I got my B.Eng in Ocean Engineering and Technology from Zhejiang University [(ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/).

My current research interest lies in underwater sensing. My long-term vision is to build low-power, low-cost, and applicable underwater sensing systems. If you are also interested in ultra-low-power computing and communication, batteryless sensing, or underwater applications, you are welcome to email me to brainstorm or explore techniques!
